# Espressoscript

A strongly-typed compile to javascript component based language built for speed,
correctness at runtime and ease of development.

## Goals
As there are many compile to Javascript languages out there, there must be something
unique to help Espressoscript stand out. The main goals are to build a language that
is easy to code in, has built allows the developer to catch errors during compile time, and 
is statically typed with biunification typing which allows a robust type interference
system.

Basically the goals are to have the helpful error messages of Elm, the easy of writing
components like React and the expressive type system of Typescript.

## Syntax
